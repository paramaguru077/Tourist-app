Ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft) can also be cheaper than taxis.\n*   **Food:** Avoid eating at fancy restaurants. Look for happy hour deals, fast food, or affordable casual dining options. Consider bringing some snacks and drinks.\n*   **Gambling:** Set a strict gambling budget and stick to it. It's easy to overspend in Vegas!\n*   **Shows:** Free shows like the Bellagio Fountains and Mirage Volcano are great alternatives to expensive ticketed shows.\n*   **Flexibility:** Be open to changing your plans based on deals and opportunities you find while you're there.\n\n**How to Use This JSON:**\n\n*   **Copy and Paste:** Copy the entire JSON code block.\n*   **JSON Viewer/Formatter:** Paste it into a JSON viewer/formatter (many free online tools are available) to make it easier to read and navigate.\n*   **Programmatic Use:** If you're a developer, you can parse this JSON data in your application to create a travel app or website.\n\nRemember to double-check prices and availability before your trip.
